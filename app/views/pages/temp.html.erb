<h1 style='text-align: center; top: 50%;'>Dear Students, We are very sorry that our ISOP volunteers will not be able to provide you with bus trips to Washington DC and Philadelphia, free bikes, free bike repairs, free dinners four nights a week or assistance this summer due to the coronavirus. We were hoping the pandemic would be completely under control by summer 2021 but that does not appear to be the case. We are very much looking forward to seeing you in 2022.</h1>
